# TextGame

A simple game that runs in a Java Swing form. Move the "O" character to dodge the "V" projectiles. The number of incoming projectiles grows over time. On Easy difficulty you can move into a projectile on the bottom row, on Hard difficulty you can't touch projectiles even from the side.

The Settings menu allows you to change the game difficulty (which affects the game speed and number of projectiles spawned) and the width of the game field (increasing or decreasing how much room you have to manoeuvre) and turn on invincibility. 

Controls: use left and right arrow keys to move and Space or R to reset (or click on the corresponding buttons).

Launch the game by double-clicking TextGame-1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar in the "target" folder.
